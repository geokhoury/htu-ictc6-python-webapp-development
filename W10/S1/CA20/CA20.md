## Flask Blog

1. Run and test out the [Flask Blog](../flask-blog/) application.
2. Use WTForms to build all of the forms on the application.
3. Enhance your data model and add a first and last name to each user. Also add a short user biography.
   * When displaying the posts display the first and last name of the author instead of username.
4. Create an edit profile page where users can edit their profile attributes.
   * Users can change their **first and last name**.
   * Users can change their **biography**.
5. Create a change password page with a confirmation for the password.
6. Build Flask blueprints to further decouple your application into views.
7. Use a view decorator to build a `login_required` decorator.
8. Build a simple dashboard which shows the following:
   * A greeting for the logged in user.
   * How many posts were written by the user?
   * Display the three most recent posts written by the users?
